        Excellent resource on mode_t: https://jameshfisher.com/2017/02/24/what-is-mode_t/

        mode_t: composed of a bunch of bit packed booleans for description of file permissions
        difficult to read the bitmasks.. research into it later but basically value based on groups
        etc as expected

        size_t: this type just focuses around returning the size of an allocated block of memory/
        size of objects in memory
        now onto the new: 
        ssize_t: ... a signed version of size-t
